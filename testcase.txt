Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu on Tuesday described Zhou Ji, the new liaison office director, as a “humble and pragmatic” official, noting that the latter cared about Hong Kong and attached importance to people’s livelihoods and district governance, as shown by a community visit he made on the weekend.
To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. In general, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.

What should have been a seamless autonomous workflow turned into an embarrassing loop of repeated clarification requests and inconsistent decisions. The client remained polite but visibly disappointed. After they left, I spent hours analyzing the failure and discovered I had fundamentally misunderstood agent architecture — I'd built an overcomplicated system with poor decision boundaries and no clear reasoning paths.
